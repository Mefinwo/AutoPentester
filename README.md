# AutoPentester
## Description
This Tool is supposed to do simple tasks like scanning targets and to save time for pentesters. 
For example, at the current state, it automates a basic tcp scan, a scan for services and an OS detection scan, this can all be done with a few commands but like this it is all done with one command and the results are neatly packed together. 
## Installation
After cloning the newest version of the repository open a terminal and type the following command: 
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
After succesfully installing all requirements, go into your terminal and start the programm  with
```bash
sudo python3 nmap_scans.py <target> <args>
```
Possible arguments are:
    -lu / --lookup
        performe different kinds of scans
## Future
In the future I am planning on adding multiple kinds of vulnability scanning and after that I might touch auto exploitation aswell.
## Contribution
At this time, I don't accept direct contributions to the repository, but as I am still learning feel free to send any feedback and tips via the contact information below.
I am aware that there are other, better, projects like this out there, but I try to keep the influence from other projects onto this at a minimal as I am learning concepts of cyber security aswell while working on this.
